# Calling-Web-APIs
Our program gathers data from a API about Stars Wars characters. The program will give you 10 characters to pick from and the program will output information like gender, eye color, weight, height, and birth year of the chosen character. 
Next, if you answer to the question "Do you want to learn about more characters?", the program  will output 10 more characters to pick from. Once you pick another character, their data will be outputted.
